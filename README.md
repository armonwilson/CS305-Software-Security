# CS-305-Software-Security

The course focused on software security, emphasizing the development of secure code and the application of encryption technologies. The two projects in the course were designed to assess the student's ability to analyze and mitigate security vulnerabilities in a web-based software application.

***Client and Software Requirements***

The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that utilizes a web-based software application to manage sensitive client data and financial information. The company sought assistance in addressing potential security vulnerabilities within their application. The primary concern was ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data, especially during transmission. The company also wanted to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

***Identifying and Addressing Vulnerabilities***

The process of identifying software security vulnerabilities involved a combination of manual code review and static testing using tools like the dependency-check plugin. The manual review allowed for a deeper understanding of the code's logic and potential weaknesses, while the static testing tool helped identify vulnerabilities within third-party libraries. The combination of these approaches ensured a thorough assessment of the application's security posture. Secure coding is paramount in today's digital landscape, where cyberattacks and data breaches are prevalent. It safeguards sensitive information, protects user privacy, and maintains the trust and reputation of the company. By prioritizing software security, companies can mitigate risks, avoid financial losses, and ensure the continued operation of their critical systems.

***Challenges and Lessons Learned***

The vulnerability assessment process presented both challenges and valuable learning experiences. The manual code review was particularly helpful in understanding the application's architecture and identifying potential weaknesses. However, it was also time-consuming and required careful attention to detail. The dependency-check tool proved to be a valuable asset in identifying vulnerabilities within third-party libraries, highlighting the importance of dependency management in software security. The process of refactoring the code to incorporate security enhancements was both challenging and rewarding. It required a deep understanding of secure coding practices and careful consideration of potential impacts on the application's functionality. The use of tools like the dependency-check plugin and techniques like checksum verification and HTTPS implementation proved to be effective in mitigating vulnerabilities and enhancing the application's security.

***Enhancing Security and Future Practices***

The project involved increasing layers of security by implementing various measures. The use of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm ensured data integrity during transmission, while the transition from HTTP to HTTPS provided secure communication channels. Improved error handling and the use of the dependency-check tool further strengthened the application's security posture. In future assessments, a combination of manual code reviews, static analysis tools, and dynamic testing techniques would be employed to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. The specific mitigation techniques would be chosen based on the nature of the vulnerabilities, the application's requirements, and industry best practices.

***Ensuring Functionality and Security***

To ensure the code and software application remained functional and secure after refactoring, thorough testing was conducted. Unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests were performed to verify that the application behaved as expected and that the security enhancements did not introduce new vulnerabilities. The dependency-check tool was rerun after refactoring to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced through code changes or updated dependencies.

***Valuable Resources and Tools***

Several resources, tools, and coding practices proved valuable throughout the project and will likely be helpful in future assignments or tasks. The "Iron-Clad Java" textbook provided a solid foundation in secure coding practices, while the dependency-check plugin proved to be an indispensable tool for identifying vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. The hands-on experience gained in implementing cryptographic hash functions, configuring SSL/TLS, and improving error handling will be valuable assets in future security-related tasks.

***Showcasing Skills to Employers***

This assignment provides concrete examples of skills, knowledge, and experience that can be showcased to future employers. The ability to analyze and mitigate security vulnerabilities in a web-based application demonstrates proficiency in secure coding practices and a strong understanding of software security principles. The use of tools like the dependency-check plugin and the implementation of cryptographic hash functions and secure communication protocols highlight technical expertise in addressing real-world security challenges. The projects showcase problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work independently to achieve project goals. These qualities are highly valued by employers seeking software developers with a focus on security.
